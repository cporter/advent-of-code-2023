# advent-of-code-2023

Kickin' it 2015 style with [D](https://dlang.org/).

For any day's problem, it's probably

    cd dayN
    dub build
    ./dayN < input.txt

* [Day 1](day1/source/app.d). Fun little problem. Probably could have done more with ranges.
* [Day 2](day2/source/app.d). Need to spend a little more time and not just write Python in D.
